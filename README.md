##Simple Shell Project

Welcome to the Simple Shell project, a basic UNIX command line interpreter that evolves through multiple tasks.

## Task 0: Starting Point

The tool reads and shows things you type.

## Task 1: Simple Shell 0.1

Now the tool can do simple things you tell it and will show you the results.

## Task 2: Simple Shell 0.2

An even better version that understands and does more things when you give it instructions.

## Task 3: Simple Shell 0.3

Now it can handle where to find stuff so it doesn't waste time looking in the wrong places.

## Task 4: Simple Shell 0.4

The latest version has a special trick. It can be told to stop and go away using the 'exit' command.

## Task 5: Simple Shell 1.0

The newest version builds on Task 4. You can use the 'env' command to see a list of things about your computer.

## Task 6: Simple Shell 0.1.1

The tool can read input more efficiently with a custom `getline` function.

## Task 7: Simple Shell 0.2.1

The tool processes input without using the `strtok` function.

## Task 8: Simple Shell 0.4.1

You can use the built-in `exit` command with an optional status code.

## Task 9: setenv, unsetenv

Implement the built-in commands `setenv` and `unsetenv` to manage environment variables.

## Task 10: cd

Implement the `cd` command to change the current directory.

## Task 11: ;

Handle the `;` command separator to execute multiple commands sequentially.

## Task 12: && and ||

Handle the `&&` and `||` logical operators to control command execution based on the success of previous commands.

## Task 13: alias

Implement the `alias` built-in command to manage command aliases.

## Task 14: Variables

Handle variable replacement and provide access to special variables like `$?` and `$$`.

## Task 15: Comments

Handle comments in the input, denoted by `#`.

## Task 16: File as Input

Allow the shell to read commands from a file and execute them.
